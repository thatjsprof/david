# Leveraging lambda layers to share dependencies across multiple lambda functions

## Introduction

In the context of AWS (Amazon Web Services), a Lambda Layer refers to a distribution mechanism for reusable libraries, custom runtimes, or other function dependencies in AWS Lambda. Lambda Layers provide a way to manage and share code or dependencies across multiple Lambda functions.

## Why would you need a lambda layer?

There are a couple of reasons why you would consider using a lambda layer with your lambda functions, some of which include:

1. <b>Code Reusability:</b> Lambda Layers allow you to package and deploy common code or dependencies separately from your Lambda functions.
2. <b>Seperation of concerns:</b> Layers enable a separation of concerns between your function code and external dependencies. This separation can make your function code cleaner and more focused on business logic.
3. <b>Size Limitations:</b> AWS Lambda has a size limitation for the deployment package of a function. By using Layers, you can reduce the size of the function deployment package and stay within these limits.
4. <b>Usage across functions:</b> A single Layer can be attached to multiple Lambda functions, allowing you to share the same set of libraries or dependencies across multiple functions.
5. <b>Custom Runtimes:</b> Layers also support custom runtimes, enabling you to bring your own runtime to Lambda. This is useful for scenarios where you have specific language runtime requirements.
6. <b>Optimize cold starts:</b> By placing dependencies in a Layer, you can help optimize cold starts. The runtime dependencies are loaded once and can be reused across multiple invocations.

## How do lambda layers work?

When creating a new lambda function, you would typically attach the lambda layer to it. When the lambda function is invoked, AWS Lambda automatically mounts the contents of the attached layers in the `/opt` directory of the functions execution environment.
In your lambda function you would then import dependencies, modules or functions from the `/opt` path. The structure inside the `/opt` directory corresponds to the structure of the Lambda Layer. For example, if your lambda layer zip file contains a assets directory, you would access it in your function as `/opt/assets`.

## Creating a lambda layer

Let's use AWS CDK to see how we would attach a lambda layer to a lambda function.

To start, create a new cdk lambda stack.

```js
// lambda-stack.ts

import * as cdk from "aws-cdk-lib";

class LambdaStack extends cdk.Stack {
    constructor(scope, id, props) {
        super(scope, id, props);
    }
}
```

Now let's add the code to create a new lambda function

```js
// lambda-stack.ts

import * as cdk from "aws-cdk-lib";
import * as lambda from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";

class LambdaStack extends cdk.Stack {
    constructor(scope, id, props) {
        super(scope, id, props);

        // Create new lambda function
        const newLambda = new lambda.Function(
            this,
            `LambdaFunction`,
            {
                functionName: `LambdaFunction`,
                runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
                handler: "index.handler",
                timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(250),
                code: lambda.Code.fromAsset("path-to-lambda-code"), // replace with the path to the directory of your lambda code or the zip file.
            }
        );
    }
}
```

Now let's create our lambda layer and attach to the lambda function

```js
// lambda-stack.ts

import * as cdk from "aws-cdk-lib";
import * as lambda from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";

class LambdaStack extends cdk.Stack {
    constructor(scope, id, props) {
        super(scope, id, props);

        // Create new lambda layer
        const newLayer = new lambda.LayerVersion(
            this,
            `LambdaLayer`,
            {
                layerVersionName: `LambdaLayer`,
                code: lambda.Code.fromAsset("path-to-layer-code"), // replace with the path to the directory of your lambda layer code or the zip file.
                compatibleRuntimes: [lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X],
                description: "Lambda Layer for test",
            }
        );

        const newLambda = new lambda.Function(
            this,
            `LambdaFunction`,
            {
                functionName: `LambdaFunction`,
                runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
                handler: "index.handler",
                timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(250),
                layers: [newLayer],
                code: lambda.Code.fromAsset("path-to-lambda-code"), // replace with the path to the directory of your lambda code or the zip file.
            }
        );
    }
}
```

That's it. You can then deploy this stack with the rest of your infrastructure by running `cdk deploy`

## Using code from lambda layers in a lambda function

Create a directory where the code for your layer function would live and create an index.js file inside. This is the same directory you referenced when creating the layer.

We would write a test function which we can export from the layer to be accessed by our lambda function. You can also install external package dependencies.

```js
// layer/index.js

const addFunction = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2

export { addFunction }
```


Let's try to access the `addFunction` in our lambda function

```js
//lambda/index.js

import { addFunction } from '/opt'

// use addFunction here
```

As we can see from above, we can access code defined in our lambda layer inside the lambda function.

### **Optional section**

If you are using typescript locally, importing from the `/opt` directory would cause type errors so you should create a link in your `tsconfig.json` file so that typescript is aware such a path exists

```json
{
    "paths": {
      "/opt": [
        "path-to-layer-code" // define path to your layer code relative to your lambda function
      ],
    },
}
```

Note that you might also want to exclude the `/opt` path from being compiled given that it is now an external package

```json
{
    "paths": {
      "/opt": [
        "path-to-layer-code" // define path to your layer code relative to your lambda function
      ],
    },
    "exclude": [
        "/opt/**/*"
    ]
}
```

If you are using a bundler like webpack for example, in your `webpack.config.js` you would also want to specify the `/opt` directory as an external module to prevent it from being bundled together with your source code

```js
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
    externals: {
        "/opt": "commonjs /opt",
    },
}
```

There you have it folks. You can now use lambda layers in your next project.
