## Introduction

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline is a set of automated processes that facilitate the continuous integration and delivery of software applications.

This is a short write-up that provides a quick codepipeline setup in AWS cdk for automating code deployment anytime code is pushed to a github repository.

## What is codebuild and codepipeline?

### Codepipeline
- AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that orchestrates the workflow of your release process.
- It allows you to define and visualize your release process using a pipeline model.
- The pipeline consists of stages, and each stage can have one or more actions.
- CodePipeline integrates with build services like AWS CodeBuild for compiling, testing, and packaging the application.

### Codebuild
- CodeBuild allows you to use pre-configured build environments or define custom build environments using build specifications (buildspec.yml).
- CodeBuild is often used as a build provider within a CodePipeline stage.
- In a typical setup, a CodePipeline build stage triggers CodeBuild to perform the build and test actions.

## Why this writeup?
- I tried to come up with a way to trigger a build whenever a pull request is raised to a target branch but could not find relevant resources.
- To save someone minutes or hours of debugging.


## The Pipeline Script

class PipelineStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const env = "dev" // Specify the environment based on your organizations requirements.

    // Initialize your application stack here
    new YourAppStack(this, "your-app-stack-name", {});

    const buildEnvironment: codebuild.BuildEnvironment = {
      buildImage:
        codebuild.LinuxBuildImage.fromDockerRegistry("node:18.18.2-slim"),
    };

    // Create a new pipeline role
    const pipelineRole = new iam.Role(this, `PipelineRole-${env}`, {
      assumedBy: new iam.ServicePrincipal("codebuild.amazonaws.com"),
      roleName: `PipelineRole-${env}`,
    });

    // Attach relevant policies
    pipelineRole.addToPolicy(
      new iam.PolicyStatement({
        actions: [
          "cloudformation:*",
          "ssm:*",
          "iam:*",
          "lambda:InvokeFunction",
        ],
        resources: ["*"],
      })
    );

    pipelineRole.addToPolicy(
      new iam.PolicyStatement({
        actions: ["sts:AssumeRole"],
        resources: ["*"],
      })
    );

    // Add your github auth token to AWS secrets manager and grant codebuild access.
    new codebuild.GitHubSourceCredentials(this, "GithubCredentials", {
      accessToken: cdk.SecretValue.secretsManager("name-of-secret"), // replace with the name of your secret.
    });

    // Create a github source connection for codebuild
    const gitHubSource = codebuild.Source.gitHub({
      owner: "repo-owner", // replace with your github owner name.
      repo: "repo-name", // replace with your github repo name.
      cloneDepth: 1,
      webhook: true,
      branchOrRef: env,
      reportBuildStatus: true,
      webhookFilters: [
        // Specify the events you want the build to be triggered for.
        codebuild.FilterGroup.inEventOf(
          codebuild.EventAction.PULL_REQUEST_CREATED,
          codebuild.EventAction.PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED,
          codebuild.EventAction.PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED
          codebuild.EventAction.PULL_REQUEST_MERGED
        ),
      ],
    });

    // Create a new codebuild project. Codebuild provides a build environment to build your project.
    const project = new codebuild.Project(this, `CodebuildProject-${env}`, {
      projectName: `CodebuildProject-${env}`,
      source: gitHubSource,
      description: "project-description", // replace with your project description.
      environment: buildEnvironment,
      role: pipelineRole,
      concurrentBuildLimit: 1, // this ensures that you only have one build running per time to prevent multiple stack updates.
      buildSpec: codebuild.BuildSpec.fromObject({
        version: "0.2",
        phases: {
          // Specify your pre-build commands here
          pre_build: {
            commands: [],
          },
          // Specify your build commands here
          build: {
            commands: [],
          },
        },
      }),
    });

    // Create a S3 bucket that codepipeline would use to store information regarding your builds
    const artifactBucket = new s3.Bucket(scope, `ArtifactBucket-${env}`, {
        versioned: true,
        removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
    });

    // Create a new codepipeline to organize your build process
    const pipeline = new codepipeline.Pipeline(scope, `PipelineName-${env}`, {
        pipelineName: `PipelineName-${env}`,
        artifactBucket,
    });

    // Grant codepipeline access to your github repository
    const githubAction = new codepipeline_actions.GitHubSourceAction({
        actionName: "GitHubSource",
        output: new codepipeline.Artifact(),
        oauthToken: cdk.SecretValue.secretsManager("name-of-secret"), // replace with the name of your secret.
        owner: "repo-owner", // replace with your github owner name.
        repo: "repo-name", // replace with your github repo name.
        branch: env,
        trigger: codepipeline_actions.GitHubTrigger.WEBHOOK, // This enables github to setup webhooks that reference codepipeline which are triggered whenever a push is made to the target repository.
    });

    // Attach your codebuild project to the pipeline
    const buildAction = new codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction({
        actionName: "BuildAction",
        project,
        input: githubAction.actionProperties.outputs?.[0] as codepipeline.Artifact,
    });

    // Setup your pipeline stages. First stage is to connect to github and the second is to trigger the build.
    pipeline.addStage({
        stageName: "Source",
        actions: [githubAction],
    });

    pipeline.addStage({
        stageName: "Build",
        actions: [buildAction],
    });

    // Add this section if you want to send build status reports to a lambda function.
    const buildLambda = new lambda.Function(this, "PipelineBuildLambda", {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
      handler: "index.handler",
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset("path-to-function-code"),
    });

    const snsTopic = new sns.Topic(this, `CodeBuildNotifications-${env}`, {
      topicName: `CodeBuildNotifications-topic-${env}`,
      displayName: `CodeBuildNotifications-${env}`,
    });

    snsTopic.grantPublish(project);
    snsTopic.grantPublish(buildLambda);
    snsTopic.addSubscription(
      new subscription.LambdaSubscription(buildLambda)
    );

    project
      .onBuildStarted("BuildStarted", {
        description: "Rule to send notification on build start",
      })
      .addTarget(new targets.SnsTopic(snsTopic));
    project
      .onBuildFailed("BuildFailed", {
        description: "Rule to send notification on unsuccessful build",
      })
      .addTarget(new targets.SnsTopic(snsTopic));
    project
      .onBuildSucceeded("BuildSucceded", {
        description: "Rule to send notification on successful build",
      })
      .addTarget(new targets.SnsTopic(snsTopic));
  }
}
```

I have added relevant comments to explain each step. Feel free to use on your next project.

Whenever you push code or raise a pull request against your target repository, you should see your build trigger on AWS Codebuild.
