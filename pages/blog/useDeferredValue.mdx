## What is the useDeferredValue hook?

useDeferredValue is a React Hook introduced in React 18. It's used to create a deferred value. A deferred value is a value that represents the most recent state but is potentially outdated. This can be useful for optimizing the rendering performance of certain components.

## Exploring an example of using the hook

Let's say we have a list that changes based on a search parameter. Rapidly typing into the search input would cause the list component to be re-rendered multiple times.
&nbsp;
What if we had a way to abandon re-renders until the last deferred value? That's where the hook comes into play.
&nbsp;
List component example:

```jsx
import React, { useDeferredValue } from "react";

const ListWrapper = () => {
  const [search, setSearch] = useState("");
  const deferredSearch = useDeferredValue(search);

  const updateSearch = (e) => {
    setSearch(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={search} onChange={updateSearch} />
      <List search={deferredSearch} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Now the list component receives the deferred search value and renders in between re-renders are abandoned hence improving the performance of the component.
